            The Andromeda constellation consists of 16 stars visible in the
            northern sky. Named by ancient Greeks after the mythological
            Andromeda princess, the constellation contains the Andromeda Galaxy,
            the nearest full-fledged galaxy to our own Milky Way.
            <br />
            The Story of Andromeda
          </h5>

          <h5>
            Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen
            of Joppa, a country on the Mediterranean coast. Queen Cassiopeia
            boasted that she and her daughter were more beautiful than the
            Nereids, the sea-nymph attendants of the sea god Poseidon and the
            sea goddess Thetis. Some stories say that both Thetis and
            Amphitrite, who was the wife of the sea god Poseidon (and in some
            places considered an alternate sea goddess) were also Nereids. This
            meant that Cassiopeia had insulted the gods with her boast. The
            Nereids begged Poseidon to punish Cassiopeia. Poseidon sent flood
            waters carrying a sea monster (in some versions named Cetus) to
            destroy the kingdom.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            An oracle told Cepheus that the only way to appease Poseidon and
            save the kingdom was to sacrifice Andromeda to the monster.
            Andromeda was chained to a seaside cliff to be eaten by the monster.
            Perseus, a son of Zeus and a mortal mother, was on his way home from
            carrying out his pledge to destroy the Medusa. He saw Andromeda in
            peril and instantly fell in love with her. He offered to destroy the
            monster, rescue Andromeda, and save the kingdom in return for her
            hand in marriage. Cepheus and Cassiopeia agreed reluctantly (having
            already promised her to someone else). Perseus killed the monster
            and freed the princess. Andromeda insisted on keeping the promise
            made by her parents and married Perseus. As a reward, the goddess
            Athena (who had been helping Perseus to defeat the Medusa) placed an
            image of Andromeda in the stars.

            Aquarius is a constellation in the Western Zodiac and one of 88
            official constellations according to the International Astronomical
            Union (IAU). The constellation describes a large group of stars that
            ancient Greek astronomers saw as a picture in the night sky.
            Aquarius was said to represent a "cup bearer" or "water bearer,"
            which is what its name means in Latin.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            Aquarius is a member of the Zodiac, a group of constellations that
            the Sun travels through each year. It is best viewed in the fall in
            the southern sky, although much of the northern hemisphere can see
            the Waterbearer in the spring. Aquarius is one of the oldest
            constellations in the sky. In Greek myth, Aquarius was Ganymede, the
            young boy kidnapped by Zeus. Zeus sent his eagle, Aquila, to snatch
            Ganymede out of the fields where the boy was watching over his
            sheep. Ganymede would become the cupbearer for the Olympian gods.
            The constellation, Crater, is often thought to be Ganymede's cup.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            The Sumerians also believed that Aquarius brought on a sort of
            global flood. Also, many of the stars that make up Aquarius have
            names that refer to good luck. This is most likely due to the time
            of year when the Sun would rise in Aquarius. It happened to be at
            the same time when the rainy season began in the Middle East. You
            have to use some imagination to see a figure of a boy in the sky.
            Look at the constellation in the same position as the one pictured.
            The head is on the right end. Moving left, you can see what could be
            an arm dangling down. Continue left more, and you come to the lower
            half of the body. Notice the legs are bent. This may represent the
            position of Ganymede while being carried by Aquila to Mount Olympus.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            There are three globular clusters in Aquarius that may be viewed
            through a small telescope. The planetary nebula, named the Saturn
            Nebula, is also in the Waterbearer. It is so named because it looks
            like the planet Saturn when viewed through a telescope. The closest
            and brightest planetary nebula is the Helix Nebula, located directly
            east of the "foot".

            Babylonians identified Aries as the agrarian worker, the last stop
            on the ecliptic. The name of the constellation later changed to Ram,
            but why Babylonians changed it is uncertain. In the 7th century BC,
            Neo-Babylonians did a revision of the Babylonian zodiac that placed
            Alpha Arietis, Hamal, very close to the vernal equinox, which is how
            Aries came to be so prominent among the zodiac signs in astrology.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            in those times, Aries contained the equinox, the point at which the
            Sun crosses the celestial equator from north to south. Because of
            precession (slow wobble of Earth’s axis), the vernal equinox is no
            longer in Aries, but in Pisces. In 130 BC, however, it was located
            just south of Gamma Arietis (Mesarthim) and was taken to be the
            starting point of the zodiac.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            In Greek myth, Aries is identified with the golden ram that rescued
            Phrixus and took him to Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram to the
            gods. The ram’s skin that he placed in a temple was the Golden
            Fleece, which later appears in the story of Jason and the Argonauts.
            Phrixus was the son of a Boeotian king. He had a twin sister, Helle.
            The children had a stepmother, Ino, who did not like them and wanted
            to get rid of them. She came up with a plan to put the land of the
            brink of famine by making sure the wheat crops failed. When a man
            was sent to consult the Oracle at Delphi, Ino bribed him to lie and
            say the Oracle asked for the king’s children to be sacrificed if
            they did not want the people to starve.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            Phrixus and Helle were saved by a winged ram with golden wool. The
            ram was sent by their real mother, the cloud nymph Nephele. It took
            both children and flew east to Colchis. Only Phrixus survived the
            journey. Helle fell off the ram and drowned in the Dardanelles. The
            strait was later renamed to Hellespont, or sea of Helle, in her
            memory. Phrixus was welcomed by King Aeëtes of Colchis, to whom he
            presented the Golden Fleece. In return, the king gave Phrixus his
            daughter Chalciope’s hand.

        <h5>
          Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, lay with the mortal Alcmene and gave
          birth to Heracles. Zeus' wife, the goddess Hera, jealous of her
          consort's infidelity, turned her spite on the child and attempted to
          cause him death or suffering on several occasions throughout his life.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Heracles reached adulthood and married the princess Megara, with whom
          he had several children. Hera provoked a fit of madness in Heracles,
          during which the young greek murdered his wife and children. The sibyl
          of the Delphi Oracle ordered as penance the performance of ten labors
          ordered by his cousin Eurystheus, king of Argolid. These ten labors
          plus two additional ones, as Eurystheus considered two of the initial
          ones invalid because they could not be completed without help, formed
          the so-called twelve labors of Heracles. The second of these consisted
          of killing the Hydra of Lerna, a monster in the form of a multi-headed
          serpent, which inhabited the lagoon near the city.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Once he reached the swamp, Heracles confronted the Hydra. He tried to
          cut off the heads of the beast but for every one he cut off, two more
          grew. While the two were fighting, Hera sent Carcinos, a giant crab
          that also lived in the area, to help the beast. The crab attacked
          Heracles' feet with its claws to throw him off so that the Hydra could
          kill him; however, the enraged Greek hero crushed it with his heel in
          response and continued the battle.[13] With the help of Iolaos, his
          nephew, he found a way to defeat the monster by applying fire to the
          severed necks before new heads could grow; thus, Heracles was able to
          finish off the Hydra. He buried the main head, still hissing as it was
          immortal, under a large rock near the road from Lerna to Elaeus. In
          addition, he cut the beast open so that the tips of his arrows could
          be soaked in its internal fluids, and from then on any wound caused by
          them would be fatal.
